# Transcendental-Number-Day-Calculator
Did you ever celebrate pi day (March 14) as a child?

Well now there's e day! Known to many as the 12<sup>th</sup> of April, this date is actually known as e day (2/71)!

But wait, by that logic, we can use more decimal points of these transcendental numbers to get multiple instances of their days throughout the next year. Maybe the universe didn't exist yet, but 06/14/2021 is actually the 7,182,818,284,590,452<sup>th</sup> day of February 19,665,888,509,284 BCE. This program takes the first 20 decimal points of several notable transcendental numbers, subtracts them from several upcoming dates, and sees if those dates just so happen to be the *n<sup>th</sup>* day of that number's month in some former year.

Yes, this uses American Date Format.

Current numbers include e, pi, and sqrt(2), which are 4/12 (4/11 on leap years), 3/14, and 2/10 every year, respectively.
