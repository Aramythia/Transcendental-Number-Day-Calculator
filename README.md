Did you ever celebrate pi day (March 14) as a child?

Well now there's e day! Known to many as the 12th of April, this date is actually known as e day (2/71)!
But wait, by this logic, we can use more decimal points of these transcendental numbers to get multiple instances of their days throughout the next year. Maybe the universe didn't exist yet, but 06/14/2021 is actually the 7,182,818,284,590,452 day of February 19,665,888,509,284 BCE. 

Yes, this uses American Date Format.
